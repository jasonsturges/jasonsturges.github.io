This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br/>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


##### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br/>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br/>
