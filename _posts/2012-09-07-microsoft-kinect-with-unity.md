The game is simple: the player uses any kind of throwing motion to "throw" Pradaxa at oncoming Thrombin molecules. The goal is to bind Pradaxa to ten Thrombin molecules in under 75 seconds. Microsoft Kinect for Windows was used for motion detection, while Unity Game Engine was used for the graphics.
