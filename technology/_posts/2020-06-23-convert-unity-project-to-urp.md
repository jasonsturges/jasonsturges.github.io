Migrating your project to Unityâ€™s Universal Render Pipeline can automatically correct materials.

Existing assets imported from the package manager may appear pink:

To automatically convert and correct all materials, select _Edit_ &raquo; _Render Pipeline_ &raquo; _Universal Render Pipeline_ &raquo; _Upgrade Project Materials to UniversalRP Materials_

Select _Proceed_ in the _Material Upgrader_ dialog window.

Afterwards, your upgraded scene will appear as it did previously from the basic 3D project.
